**Environmental Query System (EQS)** is a tool in Unreal Engine that allows AI to evaluate the environment and make decisions based on predefined conditions.

In an EQS query:

- **Green spheres** represent **valid choices** (higher scores).
- **Blue spheres** represent **invalid or lower-scoring options**.

For a **cover system**, EQS evaluates potential cover locations based on factors like visibility, distance, and obstacles. The AI picks the best option (or a random one from the top results) and moves there.
