## **を (Wo)**

## **に (Ni)**

- **Function:** Marks the destination, location, purpose, and target of an action.

## **で (De)**

- **Function:**
    
    - Marks the location where an action takes place (i.e., where something is done).
        
    - Indicates the means by which an action is performed.

### **Comparison: に vs. で (Destination vs. Action Location)**

- **に:** Used to indicate a destination or point of arrival.  
    **Example:**  
    学校に行く。("I am going to school.")  
    **Note:** This shows the endpoint or goal of the movement.
    
- **で:** Used to indicate where an action occurs (doing something at the location).  
    **Example:**  
    公園で遊ぶ。("I play at the park.")  
    **Note:** This particle is needed when talking about doing something, not just being at a location. **で** expresses action taking place at that location.
