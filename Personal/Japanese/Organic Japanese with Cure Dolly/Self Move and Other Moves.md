## ==**🌱 Self-Move = 自動詞（じどうし）**==

- 👩 **ある** is the  **mother** of all self-move verbs.  
     It means **"to be"** or **"to exist"**.
    
- These verbs describe when the **subject changes, moves, or acts on its own** 🔄
    

### **📏 Rules for 自動詞 (Self-Move Verbs)**

- Most self-move verbs **don’t use the を particle** because there’s **no object** being acted on. 🚫📦
    
- Many self-move verbs often end with **～ある**, like:  
      - 🚪 **開く**（あく）_aku_ — "to open (by itself)"  
      - 🔒 **閉まる**（しまる）_shimaru_ — "to close (by itself)"  
      - 🏁 **始まる**（はじまる）_hajimaru_ — "to begin (by itself)"  
      - 🛑 **止まる**（とまる）_tomaru_ — "to stop (by itself)"
    
Many self-move verbs often end with the **あ-stem** or endings like **～ある**, **～かる**, and **～さる**, for example:  
  - 🏁 **始まる**（はじまる）_hajimaru_ — "to begin (by itself)"  
  - 🤔 **分かる**（わかる）_wakaru_ — "to be understandable / to make sense (by itself)" 
  - 🍂 **去る**（さる）_saru_ — "to leave, to go away" 

## **📚 Examples of 自動詞 (self-move):**
