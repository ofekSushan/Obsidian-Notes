### **そう overview**

- **そう** = "like that" (appearance) or "they said" (hearsay)
    
- It’s not a word by itself — it’s a **helper** attached to other words.
    
- Depending on what follows, it can mean:  
    ➤ **“Seems...”** (looks like something)  
    ➤ **“They say...”** (reporting hearsay)

### **そう (as “seems / looks / appears”)**

Attached to adjectives or verbs to say something looks or feels like it is/was going to happen.  
It’s a suffix — it changes the word into a new one (like an adjective).

✅ Examples:

    oishisou
おいしそう  → Looks tasty

     omoshirosou
面白そう  → Seems interesting

     nakisou
泣きそう   → Looks like (they’ll) cry

	shizukasou na onnanoko
静かそうな女の子 → A girl who seems quiet

❗Use this when you observe something and guess based on how it looks/sounds/feels.

### 2. そうだ・そうです (as “I heard that...”)

Used after a full sentence to report hearsay — something you didn’t experience yourself.  
Works like: "They say..." / "I heard..."

✅ Example:

	sakura ga nihonjin da sou da  
さくらが日本人だそうだ  
→ “I heard Sakura is Japanese.”

❗Use this when you’re passing on info from someone else — not your own knowledge.
